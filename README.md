# Testing and TDD 101
Notes and repo for TDD in JavaScript lecture

## Testing
Testing is a fundamental part of the software development cycle. It is important to test to ensure that our system is working as expected. \
Testing happens at multiple different stages of our application development and we can structure the different types of test we do into a pyramid that signifies the different levels. \
There are several 'patterns' and 'antipatterns' to consider when approaching your tests. Check out [all these pyramids](http://www.testingreferences.com/here_be_pyramids.php)!

The og. test pyramid was a concept of [Mike Cohn](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) \
![Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid/testPyramid.png "Mike Cohn's Test Pyramid")

The top benefits and take-aways from this approach are:
1. Write tests with different granularity
2. The more high-level you get the fewer tests you should have

***

### Unit Tests
Unit testing targets small, isolated chunks of code eg. a function. \
They are easy to implement, quick to run and give very specific feedback. \
The majority of your testing should be based around unit tests.

### Service Tests
Other terms you may hear for tests around this level are "Integration", "API" and more. \
These tests start to bring together units and test them as a group.

### UI Tests
Other terms you may hear for tests around this level are "System", "Behaviour" and more. \
This is where your complete program will start to be tested to find the end result.

### BONUS: Acceptance / End-to-End / Manual Tests
The highest level of testing, usually done manually.

## Antipatterns
Consider the ice-cream cone antipattern next to this lovely ~~volcano~~ pyramid. What issues could this bring?

# TDD
Test Driven Development is an approach where we write failing tests first and then work to get them passing. This means that you will be writing tests very early in your development process if using TDD. Testing does automatically equal TDD.

# Unit Testing in JavaScript
### Frameworks
There is a plethora of testing frameworks available for you to choose from including: \
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) | [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) | [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) | [Jest](https://www.chaijs.com/) and many more...

We will walk through using Mocha and we will use Chai as our assertion library.

## Setting up for tests using Mocha & Chai
- If you've not already, run `npm init` to start a new package for your project
- Install [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as a dev dependency `npm install mocha --save-dev`
- Install [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) as a dev dependency `npm install chai --save-dev`
- Make a `/test` folder and make your first spec file eg `spec.js`
- Bring chai's 'expect' library to your `spec.js` with `const expect = require('chai').expect;`
- Decide what you want to test! Let's make a function that adds two numbers together.


**BONUS** Use [rewire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rewire) to streamline the sharing of code to you test suite. \
- `npm install rewire --save-dev`
- In your spec file, add 
```js
const rewire = require('rewire');
```
- In your spec file, make a reference to the file your code is in that you wish to test. Note it is using a relative path.
```js
let app = rewire('../theNumberGames');
```


## Writing your first test in Mocha / Chai
Invoke mocha's `describe` function which takes two arguments: a string & a function. \
The first argument (the string) says what you're testing - this will be used in the output. \
The second argument (the function) will say how we're going to test it. \

```js
describe ('addThese', () => {} )
```
Now let's fill out that function block (the bit inbetween the curly braces)
```js
describe ('addThese', () => {
  // adding code here!
})
```

If you are using `rewire`, now is the time to grab the specific function you need to test.
```js
describe ('addThese', () => {
  let add = app.__get__('add');
})
```

Now we have access to that function, we can make some assertions about it. \
For each assertion, we will call on another mocha function, `it`, which takes 2 arguments just as `describe` does - a string and a function. \
```js
describe('addThese', () => {
    let add = app.__get__('add');
    
    it('should exist', () => {
        // we need to make our assertion here
    })
})
```

Now we'll start making use of chai's library. Chai has lots of really great, semantically beautiful, offerings. Using chai we can practically write in English!
`expect(add).to.be.a('function');` - Wow that's nice! Have a look at the chai docs for more!

Our first is now looking like this and is ready to go!
```js
describe('addThese', () => {
    let add = app.__get__('add');
    it('should exist', () => {
        expect(add).to.be.a('function');
    })
})
```


## Running your tests
You can run mocha with `mocha <your-test-file>` \
Optional commands include `--reporter=nyan` for some nice output formatting and `--bail` to force and exit after the first failure.

Why not make an npm script to run this for you? In your `package.json` file, add (or update) a `"test"` script to look something like this:
```js
 "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha --reporter=nyan --bail"
  },
```
Mocha will automatically look for a folder called `test` and run through all the files at the top level. If you want it to run recursively through sub-folders as well, add `--recursive` to your test command.
